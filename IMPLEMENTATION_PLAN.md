- `FEATURE_QR_CHECKIN` - QR e-tickets and check-in
- `FEATURE_WAIVERS` - Digital waivers
- `FEATURE_PROMOS` - Promotions and voucher codes
- `FEATURE_AGENTS` - B2B agent portal
- `FEATURE_REPORTS` - Advanced reporting and analytics
- `FEATURE_INTEGRATIONS` - Third-party integrations
- `FEATURE_MAINTENANCE` - Fleet maintenance tracking
- `FEATURE_CHECKLISTS` - Pre/post departure checklists
- `FEATURE_INVENTORY` - Equipment and inventory management
- `FEATURE_AUDIT` - System-wide audit logging
- `FEATURE_WEBHOOKS` - Webhook system

## Technical Architecture

### Data Layer
- Extend existing TypeScript interfaces
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Use existing localStorage pattern
- Add data validation and sanitization

### UI Layer
- Feature-flagged components
- Consistent design system
- Mobile-responsive layouts
- Accessibility compliance

### Business Logic
- Centralized conflict detection
- Resource availability engine
- Pricing calculation engine
- Communication triggers

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for API calls
- E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Performance testing for large datasets

## Security & Validation
- RBAC enforcement on all new features
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for all mutations
- Secure communication channels

## Deployment Strategy
1. **Development**: All features enabled for testing
2. **Staging**: Features enabled for QA and stakeholder review
3. **Production**: Features disabled by default, enabled per feature flag

## Success Metrics
- Zero regressions in existing functionality
- All tests passing in CI
- Performance maintained or improved
- User adoption of new features
- System stability and reliability

## Risk Mitigation
- Feature flags allow instant rollback
- Comprehensive testing before deployment
- Staging environment for validation
- Gradual feature rollout
- Monitoring and alerting

## Next Steps
1. Complete Guide/Staff management implementation
2. Implement resource availability engine
3. Add conflict detection system
4. Create comprehensive test suite
5. Deploy to staging for validation
